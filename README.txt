# Stock Prediction with Various Models

## Overview
This project aims to predict the future price movements of various stocks using multiple machine learning models, including linear regression, random forest, gradient boosting, XGBoost, and LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural networks. The dataset consists of historical stock prices for different companies, and the models are trained to predict price movements over a given period.

## Data
The notebook processes data from multiple CSV files containing historical stock prices for different companies. The data includes the following columns:
- `Date/Time`: The timestamp of the stock data.
- `Open`: The opening price of the stock.
- `Close`: The closing price of the stock.
- `High`: The highest price of the stock during the day.
- `Low`: The lowest price of the stock during the day.
- `Volume`: The number of shares traded.

## Preprocessing
1. **Data Formatting**: Convert the `Date/Time` column to a datetime format.
2. **Feature Engineering**: Calculate the price movement over a specified number of future steps (`N`).
3. **Normalization**: Normalize the `Open`, `Close`, and `Volume` columns using `MinMaxScaler`.

## Models
The notebook implements and evaluates the following models:
1. **Linear Regression**: A basic regression model to predict price movements.
2. **Random Forest Regressor**: An ensemble model that builds multiple decision trees and averages their predictions.
3. **Gradient Boosting Regressor**: An ensemble model that builds trees sequentially to reduce errors.
4. **XGBoost Regressor**: An optimized gradient boosting model known for its performance and speed.
5. **LSTM Neural Network**: A type of recurrent neural network suitable for sequence prediction tasks.

## Evaluation
The models are evaluated using Mean Squared Error (MSE) to quantify the error between the predicted and actual price movements. The results for each model are visualized using bar charts and line plots.

## Dependencies
- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `scikit-learn`
- `xgboost`
- `tensorflow`
- `matplotlib`

## How to Run
1. Upload the necessary CSV files containing the stock data.
2. Run the notebook to preprocess the data and train the models.
3. The results, including predictions and evaluation metrics, will be displayed as plots and printed outputs.

## Results
The notebook visualizes the predicted versus actual price movements for each model and compares the MSE values across different models for each stock. The LSTM model's training process is also shown with loss curves over epochs.

## Notes
- The notebook is designed to be run in Google Colab, and the data upload process may need to be adjusted if running locally.
- The value of `N` (number of future steps for prediction) can be modified as needed.
